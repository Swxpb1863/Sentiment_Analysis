A1UM44ILLZCEI1,B007WTAJTO,Aleksandar Milivojevic,"[1, 1]","I bought 64GB version of the card to use with GoPro Hero 3 black edition.  It didn't work out.  The card worked OK if camera was set to resolution with lower bit rates.  E.g. worked fine in 720p with protune on, or 1080p with protune off.  However, in 1080p with protune on (bitrate is just shy of 6 MB/s in this mode -- much higher then with protune turned off) it was nothing but trouble.  Camera would sometime work, and sometime randomly stop recording for no obvious reason.  I first suspected camera, but testing with different SD cards, it ended up being SanDisk's card that was at fault.  My spare card, an old and cheap 16GB PNY (also class 10), worked just fine under same conditions and with same camera settings.Once it was obvious it was problem with the card, I found people on GoPro's forums that had trouble with this specific card as well (well, you always find these only after you figure it out for yourself, right?).  Anyhow, I did some speed tests with the card by doing simple write of 1GB file full of zeros using Unix dd utility to copy 1GB of zeros from /dev/zero (where else would you find that many zeros ;-) onto a file on the card.  The result was that on average, SanDisk's card would manage about 10.2 MB/s.  Just barely above the bar for class 10 card.  However, that was average over 1GB.  During the write test, the speed was oscillating with many spikes and drops.  Drops were as low as 7MB/s.  Uh.  I thought write speed of class 10 card should never dip below 10 MB/s?  For comparison, my old cheap class 10 PNY card was chugging along at constant 13 MB/s under the same test.  No spikes and no drops in speed.The card will probably work fine in most devices, as bitrates when recording 1080p video are often low enough and/or camera might have huge buffer.  But if you want to use it to record video at high bitrates, and your device doesn't have huge buffer to compensate for speed bumps of this card, you may run into trouble.  Be wary of using it in Hero3 in modes that have higher bit rates (e.g. 1080p with protune enabled).SanDisk's website lists part numbers as SDSDQUI-064G with adapter, and SDSDQUA-064G without adapter.  This conflicts with product description on Amazon.  While this is likely just Amazon not getting product description right again (a bit too common thing), it's interesting to note.[Update Apr 20 2013]:Some numbers from testing the card.  The test is extremely simple.  Write out 1GB of zeros onto the card using standard Unix dd command to read 128KB blocks of zeroes from special device /dev/zero and write it onto the card.  128KB * 8192 = 1GB.  dd displays transfer stats once it finishes.  While dd was running, I run iostat in second terminal displaying 1 second interval stats as a measure of current speed.  This was done on the Mac.  dd command line can be used as-is to repeat test on Linux system, however iostat command is different on Linux and would need to be modified slightly.  I choose 128KB block size, as that seems to be what device drivers merges sequential writes into anyhow.  Using different block sizes, results are comparable.$ dd if=/dev/zero of=test bs=131072 count=81928192+0 records in8192+0 records out1073741824 bytes transferred in 101.578307 secs (10570582 bytes/sec)So, 10 MB/s and all is good? Right? Wrong! iostat running in parallel with above dd command recorded this:$ iostat -d -w 1 disk2disk2KB/t tps MB/s123.11 76 9.12116.61 185 21.04122.94 49 5.88128.00 41 5.12128.00 89 11.11128.00 134 16.73128.00 69 8.61128.00 61 7.62128.00 99 12.36[ ... and so on until dd finishes writing 1GB of zeros to the card ... ]IMO, the last column should never dip under 10MB/s for card labeled class-10.For comparison, same test run against Samsung Pro 64GB micro-SD card:$ dd if=/dev/zero of=test bs=131072 count=81928192+0 records in8192+0 records out1073741824 bytes transferred in 52.869111 secs (20309436 bytes/sec)$ iostat -d -w 1 disk2disk2KB/t tps MB/s125.30 138 16.86117.73 157 18.03123.04 150 18.00128.00 159 19.86128.00 156 19.47126.45 160 19.73128.00 150 18.72128.00 154 19.22128.00 153 19.11[ ... and so on until dd finishes writing 1GB of zeros to the card ... ]So, Samsung is on average 2x faster, but more importantly it's speed is much more constant.

They do work fairly well with cell phones and tablets, yet not so good with cameras, in fact these cards failed to work with my GoPro Hero3 camera and the customer service rep from Gopro claimed (and I happen to agree with him) that this card is not a true class 10 card let alone UHS-1.Benchmarks with my evo 4g with all allocation sizes the write speed never passed beyond 8mb/s while read speeds wondered around 25mb/s far below advertised speeds, well write speeds arent technically advertised (probably because they are of class 4 level)Benchmarks with crystal mark reported speeds even lower (due to adapter) with write speeds around 6mb/s while read speeds wondered around 20mb/s.Needless to say, if you are not worried about speeds and only about storage, these are perfect. If you want to use them for shooting high definition raw footage however, I suggest you not to loose your money on this, because even if your write speeds are around 10mb/s as the card begins to decay it will slow down to become useless.Again this review is based on GoPro camera and high definition raw recording..

I was thrilled I copied a ton of music onto the card and used my phone as my mobile Ipod substitute, leaving my Ipod Classic on my desktop in its speaker system cradle.Everything worked fine until a couple of weeks ago. I started getting messages that seemed to say that I had removed and inserted the memory card. Of course, I hadn't touched it. Then a few days ago the phone told me that the card contained unsupported files and that I needed to reformat it. Well, I tried reformatting. After that, nothing. Nothing at all. I pulled the memory card, reset the phone. Reinserted the card. Nothing. I tried the card in the adapter on 3 computers. It wasn't even visible.I called Sandisk tech support. It didn't take terribly long to convince them that I had a problem. But they quickly offered me two 16 gb cards as a replacement. I literally laughed at them. I got the disturbing sense that this is something that they are required to try. If so, that's a lousy business practice. After bouncing me around a few time, they agreed to send me an RMA and a shipping label. I duly sent the card off a couple of days ago. To be frank, I have no idea at all when I might receive a replacement.If I weren't already in the grips of Sandisk, I would buy another card. The fact that 10% of the comments here are negative is an indication of a real quality control problem. A 10% fail rate is simply unacceptable for a product such as this.Update: Well, I do have to give Sandisk credit for customer support. I returned the card using the supplied UPS label on a Tuesday and I received a replacement by UPS on the following Monday. That's very good service. It does, however, increase my suspicion about the offer of two 16 gb because the 32 gb cards were ""out of stock."" If they were out of stock, they sure got ""in stock"" in a big hurry.

I use the card a lot in my smartphone - a T-Mobile Samsung Galaxy S3 (SGH-T999). All my photos, voice recordings, and downloads go on this card, and the downloads are transferred to my computer almost daily via USB cable. A few days ago, a video file I transferred to my computer refused to play correctly. No video, and the audio was skipping and squealing, which I recognize as the sound of a corrupted file. I thought maybe the transfer didn't complete; tried it again, same result. I tried to play the file right on the phone, and it didn't play on my phone! I knew there was a problem. I tried copying the video to my phone storage and playing it there, still no luck. Then I deleted the video and decided to download it directly to my phone, not the SD card - EUREKA. It played perfectly.I formatted the SDXC card twice - once from the phone and once through Windows - and tried the same test. Downloaded video file to the card, then to the phone. Same result both times - it wouldn't play on the SD card, but it did on the phone. All videos used to play perfectly on the SD card. Finally, I swapped out the card for my older, Sandisk Ultra 32GB Micro SDXC card. Like magic, it worked perfectly no matter what I played on it. So yeah, the 64GB card is dead. I should note that the card performed flawlessly for nearly a year up until a few days ago.Thankfully, Sandisk Ultra products like this carry an incredible Lifetime warranty - or 10 years for regions that don't recognize ""lifetime""; their Extreme line of cards raise that to 30 years! I've contacted their support for an RMA so I'll update this review as events unfold. If they replace it quickly, I'll bump this back up to 5 stars.ORIGINAL REVIEW:I'm using a Samsung Galaxy S3 smartphone. Sandisk Ultra Micro SD cards have never failed me, and this one's no exception.

This may be a one off, but I think it is a problem created by the proprietary format exFAT, that makes this card a loser, or more to the point, the poor customer who buys it.UPDATE JULY 2012After contacting sandisk, they have offered an RMA, but first they must verify that I have not tried to ""recover"" or ""wipe"" the data on the card, and I must ship it, at my expense, to Taiwan. I have since emailed them in reply to the requested information (date of purchase, photos of the card, packaging ect), and I told them that the data on their is my data, and if I could have accessed the card, I would have wiped it, why should I give them my information, stored on the card? That makes me less than happy, I am guessing that they want to discourage returns. Who would want to send data to a company, not knowing who will access it, and what they will do with the information contained? I would have wiped the card, but it was unreadable, unable to format, unable to do anything. I will send it to them, hoping that the information is destroyed, along with the bad card.Sandisk, you are asking a whole lot of your customers, and since this card has gone bad, I have had several other cards from them, go bad as well, seems to be a whole lot of cards being shipped that die in very short time periods. I used to love their products, and their older flash drives are great, still using a micro cruzer that is 6 years old, and going strong. I have not had one single microSD card, from this company, last more than three months, since I moved to the Philippines. Either they send their junk to the Philippines, or they have dropped QC from their business model, to create higher profit margins.**UPDATE 2**After emailing Sandisk, and expressing my displeasure with having to return the item, intact, so that they can ""assess"" the card, and look at/recover what ever personal information may have been stored on the card, they rescinded. I can only assume that they want to get the card back, to verify that it is bad, or make sure that you are not just trying to get a free card out of them, which I can understand. Instead of requiring me to send the card back to them, they asked that I cut the card, and send a photo of the ""destroyed"" card, so they could process a new card, to be sent to me, directly in the Philippines. I hammered them pretty hard in this review, and in the email I sent to them, regarding the bad card, and sometimes, you get results, in this case, I give them 5 stars for doing the right thing. I had no problem cutting the card, since it would not operate in any of my devices anyway, but I did have a problem returning the device, intact, with out knowing what information was stored on the card (banking, amazon account info, passwords, ect.) I would have just kept the card, destroyed it, and never bought another from sandisk. With their faith restoring gesture, I will not remove them from my list of companies to avoid. I just hope that they get better at QC. I returned another defective card to the retailer yesterday, only to find out that you MUST have the original packaging for a replacement. I was lucky to still have one of my packages, but since I bought several of the cards, I am not sure if I gave them the matching package for the card I returned.I would suggest that if you are like me, and have several devices (2 DSLR's, galaxy Tab2, galaxy Note 2, SII, LG-P920), that you find a way to mark each card/package, and keep the package, in the case that the card should go bad.

I own two, and while the high-capacity/low-price certainly makes them useful, they're not the answer to all of my recording needs. First of all, do not use this with a GoPro Hero 3 (or later model). Despite SanDisk's claims, these cards cannot handle the demands of true HD recording. GoPro removed it from their list of recommended cards because it caused the cameras to lock up and turn off. Even with myCanon VIXIA HF10 Flash Memory High Definition Camcorder--technology which is over 10 years old--the SanDisk Ultra card does not meet the requirements for shooting in FXP mode (1920x1080, 17Mbps) even though the camera says only a class 4 is required. A firmware update to the GoPro 'fixed' the issue for Hero 3 and Hero 3+ cameras, but it did so by throttling the recording speed for the cards, i.e. lowering the quality of the recording slightly.Those shortcomings aside, the SanDisk Ultra can shoot in XP+ mode (1440 x 1080) on the Vixia HF10 and it works with all of the settings of aContourROAM Waterproof HD 1080P. Is it ""water-proof, temperature proof, X-ray proof, shock proof""? I can't say. The ContourROAM is a waterproof camera, so even non-waterproof cards are safe for submersion if they're in the housing. The Ultra has functioned in 10 weather and after being dropped, so there's validity to the claim of it being temperature- and shock-proof.

A18HE80910BTZI,B007WTAJTO,"rbhatta ""A Dinosaur you can trust!""","[2, 2]","The primary reason for buying this extra capacitySanDisk Ultra 64 GB microSDXC Class 10card was to use it inSamsung Galaxy Tab 2 (10.1-Inch Model GT-P5113)and I am happy to share that you can get this to work flawlessly after some initial glitches. (Read below)Firstly you need to be aware that the Samsung Tablet Model GT-P5113 currently runs with Android OS 4.1.1 with Kernel 3.0.31-523998 and Build number JRO03C.P5113UECLK7.(Jelly Bean) My experiences shared here are with that level of Android OS your experiences may vary depending on what version of OS you are running. The SanDisk Ultra 64 GB microSDXC card purchased from Amazon (Retail Packaging) gets recognized just fine however when the tablet's Media Device A.K.A 'MTP' application attempts to talk your PC via USB cable the Tablet simply reboots! and after that the card is presented to the PC. - Really strange indeed!This baffled me for couple of hours. Firstly, I attempted to format the card (exFAT) in PC and it formatted just fine. After that I attempted to use it in the tablet to see the same behavioral oddity of instantaneous reboot of the tablet as 'MTP' application tries to communicate with the PC. This made me investigate the issue further and I determined the root cause was the fact that SANDISK now seen to factory format the card with 'exFAT' but also somehow seen to include an 'offset' of 16MB at the beginning of the card which shows up as 16MB unallocated region in the initial sectors on this card under windows disk management tool.The solution is to get rid of that 'unallocated' 16MB partition on the card. You could do it in PC but that might require some windows command line experience and using 'diskpart' utility and what not and I do not want to confuse people here with that process. For most novice users The process should be very simple, Just insert the card on the tablet and use the 'native' SD Card format tool under 'settings' that Android OS 4.1.1 has and it will get rid of that 16MB partition and happily remount it. Now after this simple process the 'MTP' application works just fine with PC to transfer files to the SD card without any strange reboot phenomenon.Not sure why SANDISK formats their Class 10 card in this fashion (They never did it with their class 6 cards earlier) and there's gotta be some technical explanation for why they include that 16MB partition that only SANDISK can give. In the end if you reformat the card in the tablet (Which defaults to exFAT) the card is seen to work just fine.Bottomline:-----------This is an awesome 64GB capacity MicroSD card from a reputed manufacturer for budget minded people and gets the job done beautifully. The read and write speeds are adequate enough for most Audio,Video & picture file formats in a tablet. The glitch mentioned above forced me to give *Four* stars instead of *Five* stars but let that not stop you from making a decision to buy it.Highly recommended!Cheers!",4,Works with GT-P5113 Samsung Tab 2!,1370390400,5/6/2013,581,2,2

I have 5 Class 6 SD 8GB Extreme III series cards all pushing 5 years old now with zero problems, all of which write nearly twice as fast. Not sure what the limitation is, Class 10 UHS-1, and 5 year newer tech should blow these away.  The 'micro' packaging shouldn't make a difference either.  I can only guess it's marketing differentiation.Again this card will write at published specs but you may want to check out the Sony SR32UYA/TQMN of the same capacity, it reads and writes faster and is a similar price, though only a one year warranty. I picked it up with a Hisense 7 Pro tablet (awesome) and couldn't wait, and they were on sale locally for $26. Was a pleasant surprise. Came with a SD adapter as well and some file recovery software (a link).  Not a fan of Sony web sites support or or documentation for any of their gear the last 15 years but these are commodities now I suppose and you can't expect much any longer.

HOWEVER(it's in caps pay attention!), when i took it out of the phone and put the microSD into the SD adapter and plugged into the sd card slot on the front of my pc(win7 x64) it asked to format the card(was already formatted by phone so was confused) so i hit ok, no biggie, it was empty anyways. windows did its thing and when it was &#34;ready to use&#34; it said the card was only 1MB(it showed 59.47GB in the phone). so my troubleshooting section of mind kicked in and i removed the card, and i just so happen to have a microSD slot in my computer's frontal bay and it wouldn't even show it was connected in windows explorer. so i took it out and put in another microsd card, voila it read, switched them out again, and nothing. so i decided to pull up my paragon hard disk utility, and it showed the same thing as windows, regardless how i tried formatting it. i gave up and put it back in the phone and mounted it.my s3 said it neded to be formatted. so i formatted it in the phone again and it showed just like it did the first time, 59.47GB. i then proceeded to install samsung kies and got my phone hooked up to my pc via usb cable, i opened the phone in windows explorer and right there it shows the phone memory at ~16gb and the sd card at 59.47 gb....i'm not quite sure what's going on with that, because the sd slots in my pc read my other cards just fine. but anyway i guess if you plan on using it in your phone or possibly other device exclusively because i can use it like a charm while it's in my phone, otherwise it seems pretty useless. so i guess just depends on what you're using it for. on a side not, be careful when you open the plastic package that contains the micro sd and sd adapter, be sure to open it over a large clear area, i opened it up the the living room with black tile floor and had to get a flashlight to find it when it jumped out on the holder(it just sets in the little plastic holder so even the slightest shake will send it flying when opening) i'm giving it 3/5 on here, but 5/5 if you're getting it for a phone, galaxy s3 at least because it works fine in mine",4,be careful with this,1354752000,6/12/2012,909,0,0

I had a 64GB Class 10 SDXC card, which worked well but was not going to fit the VMWare virtual machine I wanted to run off the SD storage. The Virtual Machine increases in size with regular use, and the operating system I was running is recommended for at least 40GB of max storage to operate properly.  Combined with the files I needed to store, and 64GB memory chip was no longer sufficient.The SanDisk Ultra 128GB MicroSDXC Class 10 Memory Card was able to handle that with ease, however I have found that the virtual machine ran noticeably faster off the 64GB chip than this one. I've actually ordered a second of these to see if I might have just received a flawed chip. If the replacement chip offers improvement I will revise this review. It provides its main selling point, more storage at a relatively low cost, so far has run reliably in my tablet computer.If storage space is a significant issue for your device and the memory can make use of 128GB SDXC, then I would recommend product.",4,Extended the Useful Life of MS Surface Pro 128,1400112000,5/15/2014,207,0,0

AVBMZZAFEKO58,B007WTAJTO,SkincareCEO,"[1568, 1694]","NOTE:  please read the last update (scroll to the bottom) - I'm leaving this review as 1 star as it appears to help others who purchased and had a similar experience.I give SanDisk 5 stars for customer service and 1 star for the product (for those manufactured in the past)  For those newly manufactured products that contain the software ROM fix, I'd give the product 5 stars.To all those who purchased this card due to all the great reviews.... and then used it in a Galaxy S4 (GS4) smartphone for storage, the solution to the problem is not one you can solve without returning the card to SanDisk for a replacement under warranty.  Believe me I tried everything that the Google searches returned as solutions... formatting as exFAT, formatting in the GS4 then copying data to the card while in the phone etc.... nothing worked... and so now please stop pulling out your hair and hopefully you will get the same result which I hope to get soon (just RMA'd and will send it back tomorrow for a free replacement under warranty).The problem (As confirmed from the SanDisk customer support rep when I asked specifically asked him):- When used in the GS4, this card will unmount itself inadvertently (may be true only for cards manufactured before the ROM patch described below was implemented in manufacturing).  This can cause the data to become corrupt (luckily was not my experience) and / or can be very frustrating as most of us are saving 13 MP camera pictures to the card (or MP4 movies that stop in the middle of the movie) and it unmounts when you view the picture in the gallery or worse, right when you take the picture (this was the issue I experienced).- SanDisk knows about this issue.  Again, SANDISK KNOWS ABOUT THE ISSUE AND WILL REPLACE YOUR CARD. Call them (info below) and they WILL take care of it under warranty.  They have a good name for a reason and they want to keep it. (sorry SanDisk about the 1 star, but I thought it was the way to get the message out to those searching for a solution)- The customer rep told me that SanDisk tried to work with Samsung to resolve the issue but Samsung refused to acknowledge a problem exists with this card and some of their phones (especially their flagship GS4 phones).- The customer rep told me that to their knowledge the card works fine in regular cameras (not Samsung GS4 phones with cameras, obviously) and even worked fine in some phones from HTC etc. that could accommodate the 64 GB cards. Hence the 5 star ratings from others.- The solution SanDisk came up with was to write a patch into the ROM of the card itself to specifically address the issue on Samsung GS4 phones (and maybe other Samsung phones like the GS3).  I was assured that the new card I would get would work flawlessly. will see in about 3 weeks.- I purchased my card from Amazon June 2013, so the ones currently being manufactured and the one I should get will have the new patch.  However, as SanDisk manufactures in batches (like most of the industry), old batches of ""unpatched"" cards obviously exist in warehouses.- I asked about a software patch I could download and was told it's not possible... hence the ""hard coded patch"" in the card's ROMSo... how to take care of the problem....After speaking with the SanDisk US customer support (link and info below), this is what I learned and did.Go to the SanDisk site1) [...]2) call consumer products support (this is the US no.) 1-866-SANDISK (726-3475)3) Tell them that the card is unmounting itself in your GS4 (I assume this is also a problem experienced by GS3 owners too)4) They will then confirm your information, approve your return (10-15 min approval window by mine was basically instantaneously), and then send you emails with a UPS return label and instructions.5) BTW, they also asked if I had a magnifying glass to ID the serial no. on the card, but I didn't and couldn't read it myself (those numbers are super small printed into the plastic... don't believe me?  take a look yourself.)  I told the rep I couldn't read them and he said no problem, they would process without the serial no.  I assume this is because they send you a new replacement card only when they receive your card you send in.  Makes sense.Well, that's it.  Problem (hopefully) solved.  Let's see in 2-3 weeks.  The rep was super nice about it and seemed like they were all too familiar with the problem.  KUDOS TO SANDISK FOR TAKING CARE OF IT... however, it would be nice if there was some type of communication / notice of the issue besides Google info sources, forums etc.  I spent hours, maybe a couple of days total hours worth, thinking it was an issue with my phone / my data transfer.  oh well, that's how it goes.I really hope that this review helps some of you out there with the same problem as me.  GOOD LUCK!!(btw, I'd give the card 5 stars if this problem was solved in the patched ROM of newer cards as the data transfer speeds are awesome on the card (tested transferring data via a card reader hooked to my computer)... if the data transfer / remaining mounted in the GS4 issue never existed (pre-patch of ROM, of course))UPDATE: 08/17/2013 - All went well with the return of the SanDisk Storage card.  UPS shipping took about 2 days from when I sent it, SanDisk verified the warranty claim 1 day later and 5 hours later that same day, my replacement card had been shipped. waiting on the new card now, but expect to test it out very soon (early next week).  will update the post after testing out the new card.  Just as a reference, I've been using a 32GB Micro SD HC SanDisk card in the GS4 since having shipped the 64GB card.  Obviously it's a different card and not the Micro SD XC kind. Other than a bit slower access speeds to the card, absolutely zero problems.... well if you don't count that it's basically filled up, hence why the 64GB option is great on the GS4. So it proves the point on the problem with the early build Micro SD XC 64GB cards.I'm happy to see that my review has helped some others out there.  Good luck to you in your warranty claim. my experience with SanDisk customer support has been excellent so far.Update: 08/21/2013 - Received the new replacement SanDisk Storage card just a few days ago (shipping back to me once they agreed it was defective was a very short time window).  Have had it running in the Galaxy S4 for a few days now without any jumps, stutters or card unloading in the middle of picture or video taking.  Card seems to work flawlessly as the SanDisk Rep mentioned it would. One would think it's such a short time to test after a few days of use, but if this were not fixed already it would have dismounted in the first 45 minutes... that's how often and how fast it was occurring. so it would seem the problem is solved. The new SD card makes the phone even more responsive when moving between pictures in the gallery and performing other tasks like copying files to the card.  Thanks SanDisk!  Unless I update this review by next week, you will know that the problem has been fixed.Good luck to those with similar problems as we now know how to get it fixed thanks to SanDisks great responsive customer service.Update: 08/31/2013 - This is the last update to this review just to ""close the loop"".  The new replacement card from SanDisk has been running flawlessly for about 2 weeks now.  I have not experienced any of the initial problems.  SanDisk really did fix the issues in the new batch of cards.Update: 12/09/2013 - The card has been running in my GS4 flawlessly since replacing it around Aug 21st.  Pretty good track record so far (~ 3.5 months) so it appears to be fixed with the newly manufactured (replacement) cards.For those that have left comments that I should change the rating upwards now that the issue is fixed (see my addition at the beginning of this review)... When searching for a solution to a problem with a purchased product, most people start at the 1 star reviews to see what others have experienced.  This is especially true for products with a lot of reviews (this is what I did in the beginning with this product).  Therefore I think leaving it at 1 star and adding the comments at the beginning should clarify the review.Thanks to review commenter ""Da Shocker"" for his input.  I think he sums it up very well when it comes to the value of files stored on media like this:""One more thing.. to those not happy with the one star rating by this person go ahead buy one. Take tons of pics vids and save some music on there then when the card crashes come back and give it a five star. A card cost $50-$100 pictures from a vacation or family event are priceless..

AWKYTPVNNZELL,B007WTAJTO,"T. Brown ""TB""","[1, 1]","Maybe there is nothing that can be done and it is just the way the technology is at this time, but to me it seems that the 64GB SD cards have very limited uses at this time because they are formatted in whats called ""exFAT32"" instead of the standard FAT32 to get 64GB from a 32GB card.  After receiving my card and inserting it into my new android tablet with, Jelly Bean, it was recognized and it did show I had 59GB available.  I then removed the card from the tablet and inserted it into my computers, a Win7 and a Vista, and tried to transfer files, photos and videos from my laptop to the card they WOULD NOT TRANSFER!  After some research on the internet it appeared that the card had to be reformatted from the new ""exFAT32"" to the standard FAT32.  All my files were created in Win XP and Win Vista - FAT32.  I also have a Win7 machine I recently purchased and can easily move all types of files between all the machines and memory cards and flash drives but could not transfer any files to this card from any computer as long as the card was formatted in exFAT32.  I had read on the internet about reformatting  the cards and it working.  My Win7 machine does not even have the option to format to standard FAT32, it only has NSTF and exFAT32.  My older computers have the older FAT32 format option and it took my Vista computer with a Dual Core processor 1  hours to reformat the card to FAT32.  After reformatting I was able to easily transfer my files, photos, and videos on my XP and Vista computers BUT not the Win7 computer.  The card works in my tablet and I am able to access and use all the files I transferred to the card in FAT32 with my Vista computer on the tablet.  BUT after reformatting it now the card only has 27GB of space available, so it was essentially reformatted the 64GB card into a 32GB card.  I will keep the card because I have a lot of work into it reformatting and transferring files and hopefully in the future I can reformat it again back to exFAT32 if and when exFAT32 catches on and an OS is made that can seamlessly use files created in both FAT32 and exFAT32.  This seems to be a good card that works well in certain situations but my advice do your research on what you have and how you will use the card because this is not simply a big GB card that can be used for everything in every device, unless ALL your files, photos, and videos are in, or will be created with, exFAT32 there are some real draw backs to this card and you might be better off just buying multiple lower GB cards if you really need this much storage space in a Micro SD card.  Or perhaps cards you already own can be reformatted into exFAT32 and double the capacity if your computer has the exFAT32 reformat option.  I have not tried it but based on my experience the last few days it seems like it would work if exFAT32 works for you. I gave 3 stars because it does work, but I feel Sandisk not fully explaining how they are getting 64GB out of this card and the possible problems a consumer might have with it is misleading advertising.",3,Works but BEWARE exFAT32,1376956800,8/20/2013,475,1,1

A1PPMB99YNFPRH,B007WTAJTO,Tom Dowd,"[1, 2]","Monday, November 26, 2012I put this in the Galaxy S3 without formatting, restarted the phone and it showed 59.4g GB of space.  I transferred all the files from the old 16 GB card and then moved all my music to the card with the phone connected to my computer by the USB cord.  Still lots of space left and the various music players seem to see all the music.Tuesday, November 27, 2012The card didn't show up on the phone this afternoon.  No message, just no songs to play and no card according to everything I could check on the phone.  I restarted the phone and got a notification that the SD card was corrupt, needed formatting and that I would loose all data on the card.  I restarted the phone again, without formatting, and the card came up like it had never been missing.  I am writing this on Thursday, 11/29 and I have not had another issue with the card.December 6Well, I don't know what to think.  The card disappeared again and I reformatted it FAT32 in an attempt to fix the problem.  The whole point of getting this large card was to have my music on my phone and not have to stream it from the cloud.  I tried several music players and went with PowerAmp because of the good reviews and that I could specify the folder to play from.  So PowerAmp is looking for the folder /mnt/extSdCard/Music and playing the songs in all the subfolders.  It is PowerAmp that tells me that folder is not available.The card has gone missing one other time and restarting the phone fixed the problem.Today, PowerAmp would not play and when I got home I found the Music folder was gone.  I also had Ringtones folder and it was also gone.  Now, I may not be the sharpest saw in the shed, but I know I did not delete those folders.  The card had other folders but not those two so it had not been reformatted.I am starting to think the problem is with the Galaxy S3.  I had a 16 GB FAT32 card in this phone that had been in my previous HTC phone.  That card was not large enough to held my music so I don't know if it was disappearing or not.  I wish this combination of phone and 64GB card was more reliable but just don't know where the problem lies.I lowered the stars from 4 to 3 but I really don't know if the problem is with the card, the phone or both.  All I know is that they do not seem to be playing well together.December 7There was a notification on the phone this morning that the SD card was corrupted and needed to be formatted.  I restarted the phone several times and got the notification each time.  I reformatted the SD card using the phone, a step I don't think I have tried yet.December 8Another MINOR problem I have is that the message counter gets stuck on 1 when I have no new messages.  The only fix I have found is to restart the phone.  That happened this morning and I got the corrupted card message again, but restarted again and the card came up OK.December 11So, the files on the card keep disappearing.  The card is mounted and the phone shows the correct free memory but PowerAmp, and file directory programs do not see any files on the card.  I restart the phone and the files come back.  Very strange.  I played music on and off all day today without a problem and then this evening all the files disappeared again. Restarted the phone and all is well again.December 15My phone upgraded to 4.1.1 yesterday and the same issues remain.  It is a crap shoot as to if music will play.  I take a lot of photos and use the service Zenfolio to store and display them.  I have an app that syncs with Zenfolio and keeps a phone size version of the photos on my phone.  I set this app to store the photos on the Samsung SD card and have similar issues with it when the data on the phone goes away.  This morning the SD card came up as corrupt again after a restart to get the data back.  It took a total of 3 restarts to get the music and photos back.December 18I have been trying to play music stored on this card today and my phone has reset several times.  Very frustrating.  I ordered a SanDisk 32 GB Mobile microSDHC Flash Memory Card SDSDQ-032G-AFFP today for about $25.00 and I'll see if I have the same issues.  Very disappointing.December 28I purchased and installed theSanDisk 32 GB Mobile microSDHC Flash Memory Card SDSDQ-032G-AFFPand copied all the files from the 64GB card to the new 32GB card.  No formatting, no fuss, no muss.  I have not had a phone reset since, have played music through Bluetooth for hours in the car, have viewed photos.  Everything just works.  Half the memory but what I have is always available and the phone works, a good trade off.  I am still disappointed that the 64GB did not work with the SG3.

A1WTQUOQ4WG9AI,B007WTAJTO,"Tom Henriksen ""Doggy Diner""","[82, 109]","Hi:I ordered two card and they arrived the next day, even faster than Prime. Unfortunatey, this 64gb MicroSD card is designed to only work with ex-fat. If you're an ex-fat fan and don't ever plan to change, this is the card for you. I've been able to take all of the previous 64gb MicroSD cards I've ordered, put them in an adapter and format them in my Windows 7 desktop. I'm a NTSF fan and find it to be much more stable in tablets.With other cards that aren't intentionally crippled, I can format the card to NTSF on Monday, ex-fat on Tuesday, Fat32 on Wednesday. It's ex-fat or the highway for SanDisk.You can use EaseUS Partition Master to format the card to Fat32 for devices such as cameras and mp3 players and many, many, many others that don't support ex-fat. That being said, you only get one shot. Once it's formatted into Fat32, attempting to format back to Exfat or NTSF hoses the card. I couldn't reformat to NTSF no matter what I tried. Once again, don't bother trying to format in your computer, ex-fat is the only choice.Any card that needs a special utility to format to anything other than ex-fat shouldn't be supported. Don't buy it! It's designed to fail.Shame on you Sandisk!Update 9/24/12:***************************I spoke with Sandisk technical support and they confirmed that Sandisk Ultra 64gb MicroSd cards are not compatible with Android 4.0 and above. This would be for Class 10, SanDisk Ultra 64 GB microSDXC Class 10 UHS-1 Memory Card 30MB/s with Adapter SDSDQUA-064G-U46A as well as SanDisk 64GB Mobile Ultra MicroSDXC Class 10 UHS-1 30MB/s Memory Card with SD Adapter (NEW VERSION) - Retail Packaging with Komputerbay SDXC USB Reader.I did not have any success formatting the class 10 card with EaseUS Partition Master. SanDisk recommended the free utility, HPUSBDISK.exe and I successfully downloaded it from Softpedia. I was  unable to format the card with NTSF but successfully converted one of the cards to Fat32 for a friend who wants to use it in a SanDisk mp3 player, that of course is not compatible with ex-fat.Acting on Sandisk advice I am returning the unopened class ten cards with the KomputerBay reader. I spoke with a patient and gracious tier-one tech support person and the party line seems be that consumers only use MicroSD cards in phones. I don't know what they're thinking: cameras, mp3 players, tablets, adapters and so on. Anyway it's a known issue.I can confirm that the class 6  64gb MicroSD card can be formatted in Windows7 back and forth to most any format so after returning four class 10 cards, I'm back to class six.It's still unconscionable to deliberately design these cards to be incompatible. I hope SanDisk will come up with a solution or recall the cards. Buyer beware.Update: 9/29/12**********************I received my two replacement class 6, 64gb MicroSD cards and it took less than five minutes to open the horrible packaging and to perform a quick format to NTSF. Done!I gave my friend the Class 10 64gb MicroSD card formatted into Fat32 by HPUSBDISK.EXE and he couldn't read it on his computer. As it turns out, the class 10 cards are not only incompatible with most devices bur also with most usb card readers.  Another trip across town.I can confirm that the IOGEAR SD/MicroSD/MMC Card Reader/Writer GFR204SD (Green/Gray) selling on Amazon for $6.99 works. So after countless hours of wasted effort, my friend has a card formatted to Fat32 that works with a SanDisk mp3 player.Once again, SanDisk has admitted that these cards are not compatible with Androd 4.0 or above, that being 100% of Android tablets and a majority of Android phones. These cards are intentionally crippled by design.To quote a friend:""Per the SDHC standard, the format is FAT32. SDXC (64 GB and larger) the spec calls for exFAT. Microsoft has limited the OS to only format larger cards as exFAT and will not allow FAT32. Also, seems they have found a way to also block NTFS. Thus far, very few Android devices can read exFAT because they refuse to pay M$ for licensing of the exFAT file system. ""To all masochists out there--buy this card.

Two 32GB cards went into a camera and a cell phone which only accept up to 32GB cards -- and one 64GB card went into my Samsung Galaxy S3 cell phone. The second 64GB card's a spare.The Galaxy S3 phone accepted the 64GB MicroSD card with no problems -- except for the fact that my Galaxy S3 only recognizes 59.7GB of the 64GB MicroSD card. I have no idea why it does that and why I lost over 5GB of an empty MicroSD card but I'm okay with that -- I guess. 60GB's is still plenty. The transfers of music, videos, and pictures between the phone's internal 16GB memory and the 64GB MicroSD card is wayyy faster than the old SanDisk 16GB MicroSD card that was in there. The same noticeably faster speeds between my desktop computer and the 64GB MicroSD card were also smile inspiring.As for the SanDisk MicroSD cards -- they work great and seem to operate pretty darn fast. They're definitely faster than the old 16GB SanDisk MicroSD cards I had installed in my camera and cell phone(s).Now -- as for the shipping -- dismal! I ordered two 32GB along with two 64GB MicroSD cards on August 21 during an Amazon Gold Box sale. According to the tracking feature they didn't even transmit the shipping info to the carrier (USPS) until August 31. All four were shipped together. I didn't receive them until September 6 -- a full 16 days after I ordered. A little over two weeks for four tiny items that were indicated on the Amazon page as being -- ""In Stock. Ships from and sold by Amazon.com"" -- at the time of purchase. They also shipped all four tiny MicroSD card packages in a way over-sized box which the USPS couldn't fit into the mailbox so I had to make a cross-town trip to the US Post Office and stand in a very long and slow moving line to pick up the box. They could have all four EASILY fit in one small envelope. Even a small padded envelope.

I use the card a lot in my smartphone - a T-Mobile Samsung Galaxy S3 (SGH-T999). All my photos, voice recordings, and downloads go on this card, and the downloads are transferred to my computer almost daily via USB cable. A few days ago, a video file I transferred to my computer refused to play correctly. No video, and the audio was skipping and squealing, which I recognize as the sound of a corrupted file. I thought maybe the transfer didn't complete; tried it again, same result. I tried to play the file right on the phone, and it didn't play on my phone! I knew there was a problem. I tried copying the video to my phone storage and playing it there, still no luck. Then I deleted the video and decided to download it directly to my phone, not the SD card - EUREKA. It played perfectly.I formatted the SDXC card twice - once from the phone and once through Windows - and tried the same test. Downloaded video file to the card, then to the phone. Same result both times - it wouldn't play on the SD card, but it did on the phone. All videos used to play perfectly on the SD card. Finally, I swapped out the card for my older, Sandisk Ultra 32GB Micro SDXC card. Like magic, it worked perfectly no matter what I played on it. So yeah, the 64GB card is dead. I should note that the card performed flawlessly for nearly a year up until a few days ago.Thankfully, Sandisk Ultra products like this carry an incredible Lifetime warranty - or 10 years for regions that don't recognize ""lifetime""; their Extreme line of cards raise that to 30 years! I've contacted their support for an RMA so I'll update this review as events unfold. If they replace it quickly, I'll bump this back up to 5 stars.ORIGINAL REVIEW:I'm using a Samsung Galaxy S3 smartphone. Sandisk Ultra Micro SD cards have never failed me, and this one's no exception. I used to have a 32gb card. They're fast and reliable and never corrupt data, which is more than can be said for some cheaper brands like PNY (those fail quite often).

I own two, and while the high-capacity/low-price certainly makes them useful, they're not the answer to all of my recording needs. First of all, do not use this with a GoPro Hero 3 (or later model). Despite SanDisk's claims, these cards cannot handle the demands of true HD recording. GoPro removed it from their list of recommended cards because it caused the cameras to lock up and turn off. Even with myCanon VIXIA HF10 Flash Memory High Definition Camcorder--technology which is over 10 years old--the SanDisk Ultra card does not meet the requirements for shooting in FXP mode (1920x1080, 17Mbps) even though the camera says only a class 4 is required. A firmware update to the GoPro 'fixed' the issue for Hero 3 and Hero 3+ cameras, but it did so by throttling the recording speed for the cards, i.e. lowering the quality of the recording slightly.Those shortcomings aside, the SanDisk Ultra can shoot in XP+ mode (1440 x 1080) on the Vixia HF10 and it works with all of the settings of aContourROAM Waterproof HD 1080P. Is it ""water-proof, temperature proof, X-ray proof, shock proof""? I can't say. The ContourROAM is a waterproof camera, so even non-waterproof cards are safe for submersion if they're in the housing.

AWKYTPVNNZELL,B007WTAJTO,"T. Brown ""TB""","[1, 1]","Maybe there is nothing that can be done and it is just the way the technology is at this time, but to me it seems that the 64GB SD cards have very limited uses at this time because they are formatted in whats called ""exFAT32"" instead of the standard FAT32 to get 64GB from a 32GB card.  After receiving my card and inserting it into my new android tablet with, Jelly Bean, it was recognized and it did show I had 59GB available.  I then removed the card from the tablet and inserted it into my computers, a Win7 and a Vista, and tried to transfer files, photos and videos from my laptop to the card they WOULD NOT TRANSFER!  After some research on the internet it appeared that the card had to be reformatted from the new ""exFAT32"" to the standard FAT32.  All my files were created in Win XP and Win Vista - FAT32.  I also have a Win7 machine I recently purchased and can easily move all types of files between all the machines and memory cards and flash drives but could not transfer any files to this card from any computer as long as the card was formatted in exFAT32.  I had read on the internet about reformatting  the cards and it working.  My Win7 machine does not even have the option to format to standard FAT32, it only has NSTF and exFAT32.  My older computers have the older FAT32 format option and it took my Vista computer with a Dual Core processor 1  hours to reformat the card to FAT32.  After reformatting I was able to easily transfer my files, photos, and videos on my XP and Vista computers BUT not the Win7 computer.  The card works in my tablet and I am able to access and use all the files I transferred to the card in FAT32 with my Vista computer on the tablet.  BUT after reformatting it now the card only has 27GB of space available, so it was essentially reformatted the 64GB card into a 32GB card.  I will keep the card because I have a lot of work into it reformatting and transferring files and hopefully in the future I can reformat it again back to exFAT32 if and when exFAT32 catches on and an OS is made that can seamlessly use files created in both FAT32 and exFAT32.  This seems to be a good card that works well in certain situations but my advice do your research on what you have and how you will use the card because this is not simply a big GB card that can be used for everything in every device, unless ALL your files, photos, and videos are in, or will be created with, exFAT32 there are some real draw backs to this card and you might be better off just buying multiple lower GB cards if you really need this much storage space in a Micro SD card.  Or perhaps cards you already own can be reformatted into exFAT32 and double the capacity if your computer has the exFAT32 reformat option.  I have not tried it but based on my experience the last few days it seems like it would work if exFAT32 works for you. I gave 3 stars because it does work, but I feel Sandisk not fully explaining how they are getting 64GB out of this card and the possible problems a consumer might have with it is misleading advertising.",3,Works but BEWARE exFAT32,1376956800,8/20/2013,475,1,1

Bought the same card in May 2013 for Galaxy S4 and it continuously mounts and unmounts.  Sometimes it is not even recognized by S4 or PC.  Amazon is awesome and pre-shipped a replacement.  It did the same thing, though.  According to Cnet, Sandisk acknowledged a &#34;manufacturing problem&#34; with these cards back in January 2013.  Said it was fixed, but the bad cards must still be sitting in warehouses.  Returned both and ordered Samsung's 64gb micro sdxc card.  $12 more and slightly slower read/write specs, but works perfectly in S4 and I can't tell the difference in its speeds compared to the Sandisk that works in my S3.",3,Awesome when not defective,1368403200,5/13/2013,574,2,2
